    "text": "Like so many of his belated admirers in recent years (including, of all people, Brad Pitt), I came to Nick Drake’s music after the fact. I don’t even recall how it happened or when it was, exactly, but it was sometime within the past five years or so. I think it started with a video of an old BBC Arena documentary about him that I came across on a torrent site, and downloaded. I remember being surprised to discover from it that he was the younger brother of the actress Gabrielle Drake, who’d starred in the early-1970s sci-fi TV series UFO and whom I’d had a fatal attraction to as a 12-year-old after seeing her play Peter Pan at a Christmas pantomime in my hometown. Watching the documentary, I was enthralled by the grainy family photos and film footage of early-1970s Britain, which were so resonant of my own youth growing up there. Everything was familiar and poignant: the hairstyles, the back gardens, the bell-bottomed jeans.\nAfter that I remember listening to a few albums on Spotify - Five Leaves Left, Pink Moon - but wasn’t exactly blown away. I’d never been much of a fan of singer-songwriter types back in the day, and the songs were so low-key that it was hard to see what all the fuss was about. Drake was famously unappreciated in his day: the Arena documentary mentions how his live sets in pubs were a disaster because the songs couldn’t be heard above the background noise. Nevertheless, a few songs did resonate: “Fruit Tree” on Five Leaves Left, and the haunting, wistful “River Man,” with its strange time signature and unusual chords. And of course the most famous title song from Pink Moon, which would later introduce Drake’s music to the millennial generation as the soundtrack to a 30-second Volkwagen commercial. Five Leaves Left remains my favorite album, however, and a year or two back “River Man” was added to my son’s bedtime playlist. Since then we’ve listened to it countless times together as he’s been falling asleep and I never tire of hearing it. There’s a great YouTube video that painstakingly explains how to play it on guitar. Last year while eating dinner alone in Jeonju, South Korea, I read Amanda Petrusich’s excellent book about Pink Moon for the 33 1/3 album series on my iPhone.1 The book is packed with interesting information, as well as the testimonies of producers and musicians of what Drake’s music means to them. It devotes an entire 30-page chapter to the 2000 Volkswagen commercial - needless to say a much-debated subject among Drake fans - that used a clip of “Pink Moon” as its soundtrack and jump-started the resurgence of interest in his music, including celebrities like Brad Pitt. I’ve been thinking of writing something about Nick Drake ever since.\nRather than a sudden blinding revelation, then, Nick Drake’s music has gradually, almost imperceptibly crept over me in recent years, like ivy growing across a wall or lichen on a tree branch, to the point where it’s become such a familiar part of everyday life that I can hardly imagine living without it. Drake himself is very fond of such organic metaphors - “Fruit Tree” being an obvious case in point - so it seems appropriate to think of his music in similar terms, as a kind of slow-growing plant that develops in symbiosis with its host.\nAll of which is to say that it was an organic, intuitive process that led me to the decision to write a blog - yet another among the many already out there - about Nick Drake’s music. Each post will focus on just one song, in no particular order, and discuss its particular meaning for me. Like the songs themselves, the posts are meandering reflections, intended to be neither analyses in the music-journalism sense nor fan-boy tributes. They’re about what the songs mean to me, personally.\nWhile the one-song-at-a-time model will be familiar to anyone who listens to the Song Exploder podcast series, my approach is the opposite of the industry-driven one taken there (I’ll be writing a separate blog post about this later). In Song Exploder the artist is given center stage to explain how their song was written and what it’s about; it’s the artist’s understanding of the song’s meaning that’s treated as the most authentic, authoritative one. I reject this assumption: for me the meaning of a song depends is primarily made by its audience rather than its author; the music we hear in our daily lives is what we make of it, deeply personal, and often contrary to its intended one. Song Exploder is a great source of information about the process by which a song was written and the meaning it had for its author, but it completely ignores the many meanings that song has for its audience. While it would of course be wonderful to have Nick Drake do a Song Exploder podcast of “Fruit Tree” or “River Man,” that unfortunately isn’t an option, and my interest here isn’t in providing anecdotes about the process by which he wrote those songs. I’m not even trying to propose an authoritative interpretation of the songs’ meaning that is a matter for discussion or debate; I just want to talk about how I listen to those songs, and their personal meanings for me. Why should I bother reading them, then, you might ask. That’s entirely up to you, and you certainly don’t have to. But I hope that if you do read them, you’ll recognize in them something of your own experience, or even something new.\nNick Drake’s music is reflective, even contemplative music. Other than at my son’s bedtime, I like to listen to it alone, watching squirrels chasing one another around trees in the garden, staring out of a train window as landscapes slowly unfurl into one another, or driving on a deserted road late at night, looking out for the glowing eyes of crossing animals. It’s that mode of watchful attention that I’m aiming for here: looking out for that occasional possum or raccoon in the headlights.\nFor many of his admirers - myself included, of course - Nick and his music have come to be the imaginary friend you never had, the cool elder brother who played guitar. That conditional-perfect “could have been” is in fact a central motif of his music, and I’ll have more to say about it another time. Suffice to say for the moment that it’s the reason for the name of this blog.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nAmanda Petrusich, Nick Drake’s ‘Pink Moon’ (New York: Bloomsbury, 2007), 33 1/3 series.↩︎"

    "text": "I’m driving home after dropping off my son at school for the day, and blasting out of the car stereo is Nick Drake’s song “One of These Things First,” from his second recorded album, Bryter Later (1971). As the song glides into its chorus, building into Drake’s part-anguished, part-ecstatic refrain, “I could have beeeeeeeeeen…” I suddenly find myself unexpectedly tearing up, and it occurs to me that it’s time I wrote something about Nick Drake.\nIf you haven’t heard the song before, have a listen to the song itself first.\n\n\n\n\nI could have been a sailor, could have been a cook\nA real-life lover, could have been a book.\nI could have been a signpost, could have been a clock\nAs simple as a kettle, steady as a rock.\nI could be\nHere and now\nI would be, I should be\n\n\nI could have been\nOne of these things first\nI could have been\nOne of these things first.\n\n\nI could have been your pillar, could have been your door\nI could have stayed beside you, could have stayed for more.\nCould have been your statue, could have been your friend\nA whole long lifetime could have been the end.\nI could be yours so true\nI would be, I should be through and through\n\n\nI could have been\nOne of these things first\nI could have been\nOne of these things first.\n\n\nI could have been a whistle, could have been a flute\nA real live giver, could have been a boot.\nI could have been a signpost, could have been a clock\nAs simple as a kettle, steady as a rock.\nI could be even here\nI would be, I should be so near\n\n\nI could have been\nOne of these things first\nI could have been\nOne of these things first.\n\nThis could possibly be the only song in the history of popular music to have been written entirely in the conditional perfect tense. The conditional perfect is the most melancholy of the grammatical tenses: it’s about what might have been, what might have happened, yet did not. It’s unsurprising that Nick Drake, the arch-melancholic, should have written an entire song in the conditional perfect, since his own life was in many ways about what might have been, what might have happened, yet did not. The song of course takes on a particular poignancy given Drake’s untimely death on 25 November 1974 at the age of 26. Yet in spite of this, there was always something of the young fogey about Drake, a maturity of outlook that belied his youth: already in this song, written not long before his demise, he’s looking back over his past life and loves, and reflecting upon the better lives that might have been, in the conditional perfect. The possibilities start out conventionally, as imagined alter egos (sailor, cook, lover), but in another typically Drakeian move, quickly turn whimsical, as Drake starts imagining himself as not even human, but a series of inanimate objects (book, signpost, clock, kettle; whistle, flute, boot), as he explores what he could have been before the musician that he is now: one of these things first. Literally. At first it might seem ironic that among the list of possible lives (and objects) considered, there’s one conspicuous absence: musician, songwriter. The reason is of course obvious: this is who he is now, even as he muses wistfully on who (or what) else he could have been instead. The song itself is evidence both of what he has achieved, while reflecting on what might have been.\n“One Of These Things First” is a song about regret, of course, regret for what one might have been or become, yet did not; but it’s also a joyous song, surprisingly buoyant among Drake’s otherwise brooding repertoire, built around a jaunty rising and falling piano figure, an up-tempo rhythm, and an uplifting chorus that tempers its melancholy; or perhaps it’s the reverse, with the melancholy lyrics giving an edge to the cheerful music. Either way, like all of Drake’s work, its dominant mood is bitter-sweet, what Brazilians call saudade or the Japanese call mono no aware: the sadness of things.\nAs I’m driving home, it occurs to me that it’s this paradoxical mixture of joyous regret, this conditional-perfect awareness of the other paths one might have followed yet did not, that resonates with the many people who connect with Nick’s music - or at least with me. It’s why I sometimes find my eyes misting over when I immerse myself in his songs, staring out of a train window or driving on an empty highway, as I too reflect, from my own more advanced age than his, on the people I could have become, the lives I could have lived, the things I could have been, first."

    "section": "",
    "text": "It’s a beautiful Spring morning, with what seems like the first sun in weeks, a brisk April breeze blowing through the treetops, cotton-wool clouds scudding across the sky, and the likelihood of showers. On the front lawn, the fuchsia-colored blossoms of the crabapple tree are in full bloom. And today’s Nick Drake song of the day, as I drive my son to school, is “Fruit Tree.”\n\n\n\nIt’s a typically exquisite Drake song, with minor-to-major shifts and unexpected diminished chords, string orchestration, and the haunting melody of a cor anglais, overlaid with the singer’s characteristically wan delivery of bittersweet lyrics. In this case those lyrics are even more poignant than usual, since they are of course a foreshadowing of Drake’s own unsung career in his short life and his posthumous fame. Melancholy even by Drake’s usual standards, they stand perfectly as a poem in their own right:\n\n\n\n\nFame is but a fruit tree\nSo very unsound.\nIt can never flourish\n’til its stock is in the ground\nSo men of fame\nCan never find a way\n’til time has flown\nFar from their dying day\nForgotten while you’re here\nRemembered for a while\nA much updated ruin\nFrom a much outdated style\n\n\nLife is but a memory\nHappened long ago\nTheatre full of sadness\nFor a long forgotten show\nSeems so easy\nJust to let it go on by\n’til you stop and wonder\nWhy you never wondered why\nSafe in the womb\nOf an everlasting night\nYou find the darkness can\nGive the brightest light\nSafe in your place deep in the earth\nThat’s when they’ll know what you were truly worth\nForgotten while you’re here\nRemembered for a while\nA much updated ruin\nFrom a much outdated style\nFame is but a fruit tree\nSo very unsound\nIt can never flourish\n’til it’s stock is in the ground\nSo men of fame\nCan never find a way\n’til time has flown\nFar from their dying day\nFruit tree, fruit tree\nNo-one knows you but the rain and the air\nDon’t you worry\nThey’ll stand and stare when you’re gone\nFruit tree, fruit tree\nOpen your eyes to another year\nThey’ll all know\nThat you were here when you’re gone\n\nAs we pull up at the school to the refrain of the last few lines, I explain to my son what the song is about, and how eerily prophetic they are of the singer’s fame, which as the song seems to predict only came to fruition after he himself was no more than a passing memory.\nI drive home reflecting on this, and back at home pause in the blustery morning to take some photographs of the blooming crabapple tree. The fruit of the crabapple tree are small, like miniature replicas of regular apples, and are too bitter to eat alone. They are edible, though, and have traditionally been made into jam. As I wait for the sun to come out from behind the clouds so that I can photograph the blossoms, it occurs to me that the crabapple tree might have been the tree that Nick had in mind as he was writing that song, with its tiny, bittersweet fruit that only become palatable after being preserved.\nThe crabapple tree in our garden is unpredictable: some years it hardly produces any fruit, others the lawn is so carpeted with fallen crabapples that it takes a weekend to clear it. This year the blooms are glorious, and it looks like being a bumper crop. This autumn, I think I might try my hand at making crabapple jam, while listening, of course, to “Fruit Tree.”\n\nFruit tree, fruit tree\nOpen your eyes to another year\nThey’ll all know\nThat you were here when you’re gone"
